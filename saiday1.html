<p> Konidala Pawan Kalyan[3] (born Konidala Kalyan Babu; 2 September 1971[2]) is an Indian politician, actor and philanthropist, serving as the 10th Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024. He is also the Minister of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development & Rural Water Supply; Environment, Forests, Science & Technology in the Government of Andhra Pradesh and an MLA representing the Pitapuram constituency. He is the founder and president of the Janasena Party.

As an actor, Kalyan is known for his distinctive style and mannerisms in Telugu cinema. He enjoys a substantial fanbase across the Telugu states, often described as "unfathomable," "fiercely loyal," and a "cult following."[7] He is among the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema and has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list multiple times since 2012.[8][13] He is the recipient of a Filmfare Award and a SIIMA Award among other accolades.

Kalyan made his acting debut in the 1996 film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi. Then, he had a streak of six consecutive hits, among which Tholi Prema (1998), Thammudu (1999), Badri (2000), and Kushi (2001) became back-to-back blockbusters. These films established Kalyan as a youth icon with a massive following distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's fanbase.Kalyan entered politics in 2008 as the youth wing president of Chiranjeevi's Praja Rajyam Party, but left it after its merger with the Congress party. In March 2014, he founded the Jana Sena Party (JSP). He chose not to contest in the 2014 elections, but through his support and campaigns played a crucial role in the victory of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Andhra Pradesh.[28] In 2017, he brought national attention to the chronic kidney disease crisis in Uddanam Kalyan's next film was Tholi Prema (1998), directed by A. Karunakaran and co-starring Keerthi Reddy with music by Deva. Karunakaran saw Pawan Kalyan's photo on a Telugu film magazine cover in Chennai and thought he was perfect for the lead in his romantic film. After sharing the script with Kalyan, Kalyan introduced him to producer G. V. G. Raju, who had worked with him on Gokulamlo Seeta.[50] The film was a major hit, launching Kalyan into stardom and becoming a classic romantic film in Telugu cinema.[51] It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu, six state Nandi Awards, and was featured at the 30th International Film Festival of India. The film was remade in Kannada as Preethsu Thappenilla (2000) and in Hindi as Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai (2001)Next, Kalyan acted in Puri Jagannadh's first directorial venture, Badri (2000). It starred debutants Ameesha Patel and Renu Desai (whom he would later marry). It was produced by T. Trivikrama Rao and the music was composed by Ramana Gogula.[59] The film became a blockbuster at the box office. Badri played a crucial role in expanding Pawan Kalyan's appeal from class audiences, who admired his earlier hits to a broader mass audience.[60] The intense scenes between Pawan Kalyan and Prakash Raj remain a significant highlight in Pawan's career.[60] The film's dialogues and songs were huge hits with the youth. The line "Nuvvu Nanda aithe nenu Badri Badrinath" and songs like "Ye Chikitha" and "Bangala Kathamlo" continued to be popular even after two decades.[61] Badri was later remade in Hindi as Shart: The Challenge (2004)Kalyan's next film was Johnny (2003), which he wrote, directed, and starred in alongside Renu Desai.[77] Produced by Allu Aravind with music by Ramana Gogula, the martial arts film featured Kalyan as a coach who fights to fund his wife's cancer treatment.[78] Johnny had the highest theatrical distribution rights of ₹21 crore for a Telugu film at the time[79] and was released with over 250 prints worldwide.[80][81] Kalyan's clean-shaven look was a departure from his usual style which disappointed many fans.[82] Despite being Pawan Kalyan's first flop after six consecutive hits, the film was praised for its stylish and grounded action choreography.[83][84] Kalyan's styling from the film became a trend, with Johnny T-shirts, bandanas, armbands, and caps becoming very popular.[85] It was also screened at the International Film Festival of India.[81]

In 2004, his film Gudumba Shankar was released. The film was directed by Veera Shankar and produced by Kalyan's older brother Nagendra Babu under Anjana Productions banner.[86] Kalyan played the title role, wrote the screenplay and choreographed three songs. The action scenes were also conceived and choreographed by him. The film, starring Kalyan and Meera Jasmine, received mixed reviews and was an average performer at the box office. Kalyan's choreography of the realistic action scenes was praised. His unique style, including wearing double pants, grabbed attention at the time.[86][82]

His next film Balu (2005) was A. Karunakaran's second directorial starring Kalyan, after Tholi Prema. This film was produced by C. Aswini Dutt under Vyjayanthi Movies banner.[87] It co-starred Shriya, Neha Oberoi and Gulshan Grover. Balu was extensively filmed in Delhi and Agra, with a special set constructed near the Taj Mahal and another in Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad, at a cost of ₹90 lakh. Pawan Kalyan wore a unique pant in the film's flashback scenes, which he bought from Italy for about ₹2 lakh.[88] These pants later became a trend among the youth.[85][82] Balu was the first Telugu film to have a release in South Africa and became an average grosser at the box office</p>
